# PythonBootcamp
2019-2020 SPS Python Bootcamp - Exercise Notebooks, Data to be used, and Startup slides. Note that the notebooks here contain the solutions, however they are given to learners with blank cells for them to fill in.

Event Setup:
Event lasts 4 hours. Present the slides to newcomers. Proceed to distribute the notebooks (empty celled) via Google Colab, and show via projection how to use Google Colab and interactive Python (key bindings, settings, etc.). Presenting the notebook is a matter of choice of teaching style (for example: speaker going through the notebook the whole time, independent learning w/ helpers on standby, combination of independent and speaker). Learners start with the Beginner notebook, and then are given the Intermediate if they have attended at least one session and are comfortable. For school semesters, it is recommended to host a workshop monthly to maximize learner coverage (multiple opportunities for at least two attendances).
And most importantly, have fun!
